        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

            <li>computer sign-on data, statistics on page views, traffic to and from Books Reselling and Ad data (all through cookies – you can take steps to disable the cookies on your browser although this is likely to affect your ability to use the site);</li>
            <li>other information, including users' IP address and standard web log information.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Use</h2>

        <h2>Using Information from Books Reselling</h2>

        <p>You may use personal information gathered from Books Reselling only to follow up with another user about a specific posting, not to send spam/phishing or collect personal information from someone who hasn’t agreed to that.</p>

        <h2>Access, Modification, and Deletion</h2>

        <p>You can see, modify, or erase your personal information by reviewing your posting or account status page. Contact customer support at Books Reselling to review any personal information we store that is not available on Books Reselling. There may be a charge associated with such requests but these will not exceed the amounts permitted by law. We delete personal information when we no longer need it for the purposes we described earlier. We retain personal information as permitted by law to resolve disputes, enforce our policies; and prevent bad guys from coming back.</p>

        <h2>Data Security</h2>

        <p>We use a number of mechanisms (encryption, passwords, and physical security) to protect the security and integrity of your personal information against unauthorized access and disclosure. Unfortunately, no data transmission over the internet can be guaranteed to be completely secure. So while we strive to protect such information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us, and you do so at your own risk. Once any personal information comes into our possession, we will take reasonable steps to protect that information from misuse and loss and from unauthorized access, modification, or disclosure.</p>
